SimpleMail
=========

Current Version: 0.5, unfinished

SimpleMail is a lightweight, minimalistic approach to sending emails via SMTP.
It utilizes the JavaMail API (https://java.net/projects/javamail/pages/Home), and 
is currently working with both GMail and Yahoo! accounts, with Hotmail support
in development. It it accessed through a simple GUI frontend, although it is flexible 
and can very easily be modified to work via a command-line interface.
